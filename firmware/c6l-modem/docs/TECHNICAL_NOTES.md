# c6l-modem: Technical Documentation

## Overview

The c6l-modem firmware turns the M5Stack Unit C6L (ESP32-C6 + SX1262)
into an RNode-class LoRa modem with USB and WiFi-TCP host links,
driven by the Reticulum-rs Rust SDK.

## Architecture (v0.5 — Single-Thread)

All tasks run on the main RTOS thread's executor. No cross-thread
communication needed.

| USB + TCP simultaneously | ✅ both active |

## The Actual Root Cause of the TCP Bug

After extensive debugging (hours of cross-thread investigation), the
TCP data path failure was caused by a **one-line omission** in
`rnode-modem-core/src/modem.rs`:

```rust
// BEFORE: TCP data silently dropped
pub fn feed(&mut self, id: u64, bytes: &[u8]) -> Fed {
    let Some((_, session)) = self.sessions.iter_mut().find(...) else {
        return Fed::empty();  // ← session 2 (TCP) never found!
    };
}

// AFTER: auto-create unknown sessions
pub fn feed(&mut self, id: u64, bytes: &[u8]) -> Fed {
    if !self.sessions.iter().any(|(sid, _)| *sid == id) {
        self.sessions.push((id, Session::new()));
    }
    ...
}
```

TCP sessions registered with the outbound routing registry (for reply
delivery) but were never added to the modem's internal frame parser.
`feed()` returned zero replies, making it appear as if cross-thread
communication was broken. It wasn't — the channel worked fine within
the single-thread executor. The select3 handler received TCP data and
called `feed()`, which returned `Fed{replies: 0}` because session 2
wasn't in the parser list.

## Build System

### Environment Variables (Compile-Time)
```bash
rm -f target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/c6l-modem
find src ../patches ../../rnode-modem-core/src -name "*.rs" -exec touch {} \;
C6L_WIFI_SSID="YourNetwork" \
C6L_WIFI_PASS="YourPassword" \
C6L_TCP_HOST="192.168.1.161" \
    cargo build --release
# Verify (cargo doesn't rebuild on env-var changes!)
strings target/.../c6l-modem | grep "YourNetwork"
```

### Dependency Stack
- esp-hal 1.1.2 (unstable)
- esp-rtos 0.3.0 (patched)
- esp-radio 0.18.0
- embassy-executor 0.10 / embassy-net 0.9 (patched)
- opt-level 2 for esp-radio, "s" for app

### Patches Applied

**esp-rtos** (`firmware/patches/esp-rtos/`):
1. Executor poll loop: yields when tasks self-wake during poll
2. ThreadFlag::set(): forced yield on flag-set-without-waiter (race fix)
3. Diagnostic counters (RTOS_DIAG)

**embassy-net** (`firmware/patches/embassy-net/`):
1. `Runner::run()`: timer-based re-poll (10ms) — the esp-radio driver
   never calls the runner's waker on packet arrival
2. Accept instrumentation: logs socket state transitions
3. Driver receive tracking

**rnode-modem-core** (`rnode-modem-core/`):
1. `Modem::feed()`: auto-create sessions for unknown IDs (THE fix)

## Hardware Findings

| # | Finding | Resolution |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | esp-radio driver never calls runner's waker | Timer re-poll (10ms) |
| 2 | esp-radio driver drops incoming TCP SYNs | Reverse-connect mode |
| 3 | esp_println deadlocks at interrupt priority | Avoid prints in ISR |
| 4 | logq static must be `static mut` | Fixed |
| 5 | Session IDs from add_session() start at 1 | Runtime USB_SID |
| 6 | Cargo doesn't rebuild on env-var changes | Documented workaround |
| 7 | StaticCell::init() panics on double-init | Direct static registry |
| 8 | select3 cancels in-flight async reads | Dedicated usb_rx_task |
| 9 | embassy-net Runner always self-wakes | Timer re-poll |
| 10 | Modem.feed() drops unregistered sessions | Auto-create (THE fix) |

## Test Suite

```bash
make c6-acceptance   # 16 protocol checks over USB
make c6-stability    # 5 open/close reset cycles
make c6-soak        # 115s continuous connection
make c6-test        # all three
```

## TCP Host Setup

The modem connects OUT to a configured host (reverse-connect). Run a
listener on your laptop:

```bash
nc -l 4990
# Or a proper KISS host using reticulum-rs:
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example rnode_listen \
    --features "iface-rnode,iface-serial" -- --port /dev/ttyACM1
```

Build with `C6L_TCP_HOST=<laptop-ip>` to set the target.

## SPI / Radio Findings (2026-09-15, deep debugging session)

### Bugs found and fixed

1. **TCXO command byte order** — `SetDio3AsTcxoClock` (opcode 0x97)
   parameter order is `voltage[15:8], voltage[7:0], timeout[15:8],
   timeout[7:0]` (voltage FIRST, datasheet Table 11-8). We had timeout
   first, which sent the timeout value (0x0500 = 12800 × 10mV = 128V!)
   as the TCXO voltage. The SX1262 rejected it and went into permanent
   BUSY.

2. **TCXO voltage encoding** — the voltage is in 10 mV steps: 3.0 V →
   `300` (0x012C), not `3000`. The formula `(v * 10.0) as u32 * 100`
   produced 3000 = 30 V. Correct: `(v * 100.0) as u32`.

3. **ESP32-C6 IO_MUX base address** — the IO_MUX peripheral is at
   `0x6009_0000` (from PAC `esp32c6::IO_MUX`), NOT `0x6000_9000`. The
   `gpio[]` register array starts at offset `+0x04` (after `pin_ctrl`),
   so GPIO N's IO_MUX register is at `0x6009_0004 + N*4`.

4. **ESP32-C6 GPIO register offsets** (from PAC RegisterBlock field
   order):
   - `bt_select` at +0x00 (NOT GPIO_OUT!)
   - `out` (GPIO_OUT) at +0x04
   - `out_w1ts` at +0x08, `out_w1tc` at +0x0C
   - `enable` at +0x20, `in_` (GPIO_IN) at +0x3C

5. **ESP32-C6 SPI2 (GPSPI2) register offsets** (from PAC field docs,
   base 0x6008_1000):
   - `USER` at +0x10, `USER1` at +0x14, `USER2` at +0x18
   - `MS_DLEN` at +0x1C, `MISC` at +0x20
   - `DIN_MODE` at +0x24, `DIN_NUM` at +0x28, `DOUT_MODE` at +0x2C
   - `W[0..16]` FIFO at +0x98..0xD8

6. **SPI USER register garbage phases** — the default USER register had
   `USR_DUMMY` (bit 29) and `USR_ADDR` (bit 30) set, and `DOUTDIN`
   (bit 0) clear. This means the SPI inserted dummy cycles and an
   address phase between the opcode and data, garbling all multi-byte
   commands. Fixed by writing:
   ```rust
   (user | (1<<0)) & !((1<<29) | (1<<30) | (1<<31))
   ```

### Current state

- `GetStatus` (single-byte transfer) works — returns valid SX1262
  status 0xD2 (mode 5 = RX, cmd_status 1 = data available).
- All init steps complete without SPI errors.
- BUSY pad (GPIO19) reads HIGH even after a fresh power-cycle. The
  radio still responds to GetStatus, so we bypass BUSY gating.
- The SX1262 does NOT process multi-byte write commands (SetStandby,
  SetRfFrequency, etc.) — the mode never changes from RX.
- Multi-byte reads (IRQ status, buffer) return the status byte 0xD2
  for every byte instead of actual data.
- Meshtastic (ESP-IDF SPI driver + RadioLib) works perfectly on the
  same hardware with the same pins, confirming the hardware is OK.

### Root cause hypothesis

The esp-hal 1.1.2 SPI driver on ESP32-C6 generates multi-byte SPI
transactions differently from ESP-IDF's `spi_master` driver in a way
that the SX1262 does not recognize. The SPI register configuration
looks correct (verified full-duplex, no dummy/addr/command phases,
2 MHz, Mode 0, MSB first), but the actual signal timing or FIFO
handling may differ subtly.

### Next steps

1. Compare SPI signal generation between esp-hal and ESP-IDF at the
   register level (clock gating, FIFO thresholds, `update()` sync).
2. Consider writing a minimal SPI driver using direct PAC register
   access that mirrors ESP-IDF's `spi_master` behavior exactly.
3. File upstream issues: esp-hal (SPI register defaults leave dummy/
   addr phases enabled) and/or the TCXO command byte order bug is ours.

## Deep Debugging Session Summary (2026-09-16)

### What was verified working

1. **SPI data path (loopback test)**: Routed MISO to read from GPIO21
   (MOSI pad). Sent [0x1D,0x07,0x40,0x00] and received identical data.
   GPSPI2 FIFO packing confirmed correct (right-aligned big-endian).

2. **IO_MUX direct mode**: SPI pins (20/21/22) use MCU_SEL=0 (IO_MUX
   direct). This bypasses the GPIO matrix entirely. Switching to
   MCU_SEL=1 (GPIO matrix) breaks MISO (reads 0xFF).

3. **SPI configuration**: Mode 0, 2 MHz, 50% duty cycle, MSB first,
   full-duplex (DOUTDIN=1), no dummy/address/command phases.

4. **GPIO matrix routing** (when active): SCK=signal 63 (FSPICLK),
   MOSI=signal 65 (FSPID). Verified via FUNC_OUT_SEL_CFG reads.

5. **SX1262 responds**: CS LOW → MISO carries 0xF6 (status byte).
   CS HIGH → MISO reads 0xFF (floating).

### What doesn't work

- SX1262 does not process multi-byte SPI commands
- Status byte stays at 0xF6 (bits [5:3]=110=TX mode from Meshtastic)
- All read commands return status byte echo (not actual data)
- Radio never enters RX mode (our SetRx command not processed)
- No LoRa packet reception

### Status byte format (corrected)

From SX1262 datasheet section 13.3:
- Bits [7:6]: reserved (11)
- Bits [5:3]: circuit mode (2=STBY_RC, 3=STBY_XOSC, 4=FS, 5=RX, 6=TX)
- Bits [2:1]: command status (1=data available, 2=in progress, 3=timeout)
- Bit [0]: reserved (0)

Common error: mode is at bits [5:3], NOT [6:4].

### Root cause (unknown)

Despite verified-correct SPI data reaching the SX1262's MOSI pin,
the chip does not recognize or process our commands. Meshtastic
(ESP-IDF spi_master + RadioLib) works on identical hardware.

Possible causes to investigate with an oscilloscope:
1. Clock edge timing (sample point vs. data valid window)
2. CS setup/hold timing relative to first/last clock edge
3. Signal rise/fall times and overshoot
4. Ground bounce or crosstalk between SPI lines

### Recommended next steps

1. **Oscilloscope comparison**: Capture SPI waveforms (SCK, MOSI, CS)
   from both our firmware and Meshtastic running on the same board.
   Compare timing, voltage levels, and edge characteristics.

2. **Try esp-idf-sys**: Use the `esp-idf-sys` crate to call ESP-IDF's
   `spi_master` driver directly from Rust, bypassing both esp-hal and
   our raw driver. This would use the exact same driver as Meshtastic.

3. **Port RadioLib**: Compile RadioLib's SX126x driver as a static
   library and link it into our firmware, using its proven SPI wrapper.

4. **Alternative: use Arduino framework**: Build the firmware with
   the Arduino framework (like Meshtastic) instead of esp-hal, trading
   some control for proven SPI compatibility.
