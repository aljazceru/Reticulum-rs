//! LxmRouter - the LXMF delivery and propagation layer over the async
//! `reticulum` transport.
//!
//! This module ports the protocol-visible parts of `LXMF/LXMF/LXMRouter.py`
//! onto the Rust `reticulum` crate's tokio-based transport:
//!
//! * creation of the `lxmf.delivery` and `lxmf.propagation` SINGLE
//!   destinations and their announce app-data
//! * delivery announce handling (stamp cost tracking, identity recall)
//! * propagation node announce handling (peer configuration)
//! * outbound direct delivery over an established link, sending the packed
//!   message as a link data packet
//! * inbound ingestion with signature validation, stamp enforcement and
//!   dedup by message hash / transient id
//! * delivery receipts and send failures via a tokio broadcast channel
//!
//! Not yet implemented (explicit integration points, see the TODOs):
//! resource-backed delivery of messages larger than `LINK_PACKET_MAX_CONTENT`,
//! the propagation node peering and sync protocol (peering keys, offer and
//! message-get requests over link resources), ratchets, backchannel
//! identification, and opportunistic packet delivery receipts (RNS packet
//! proofs are not surfaced by the transport yet).
